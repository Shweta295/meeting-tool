**Meeting Overview**
This Team Sync focused on finalizing the urgent Q4 budget submission and confirming the immediate schedule for imminent product updates.

**Main Points Discussed**
The primary discussion revolved around the critical Q4 budget deadline, complicated by a newly identified 10% overrun in marketing expenditures. Additionally, the team confirmed that all required UX updates have been successfully completed and are prepared to enter the testing phase starting next week.

**Key Decisions/Outcomes**
To compensate for the marketing overrun, the team decided to implement budget reductions specifically within the events allocation. Bob was assigned the action item to review and submit the revised financial numbers by the end of the day tomorrow. The second key decision was to move the completed UX updates immediately into formal testing next week.

**Open Questions**
The specific individual responsible for serving as the primary tester for the new UX updates still needs to be officially assigned before the end of the current week. (118 words)
